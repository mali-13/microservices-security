1. Incident commander name:
DevOps and SecOps Team

2. Executive Summary of what happened:

Attacker was able to get hold of the infrastructure and plant crypto mining application leading to performance degrading
and increased infrastructure costs. Additionally, they introduced images with a compromised and tempered bill of materials
making detection hard.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The kubernetes cluster including the main node. Additionally, the image registry contained tempered images.

4. Summmry of the impact:
 - 20% infrastructure costs increase
 - Increased cost on detecting and fixing the issue
 - User experienced degraded performance of the app

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
 - detect issue going through falco logs
 - run static detection tools: grype and trivy
 - locate the issue and plan for the fix
 - teardown intruder crypto mining pods in the cluster
 - detect the tempered image amd teardown pods using it
 - run tools and tests again to check if the issue is fixed
 - take care not to disrupt the prod environment by performing a rollout while being prepared for a rollback

6. Summary of lessons learned:
 - kube cluster needs to be hardened further
 - we need to be cautious and ensure that images that we use are authentic and come from trusted authorities
 - communication needs always to secure
