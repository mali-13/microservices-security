What changes will be introduced?

The production kube cluster will be hardened based on the official RKE guide. The following kube components will be affected:
 - kube api
 - ectd
 - kube controller
 - kubelet

The kube-bench tool will be used to assess the current state and list the failed checks.

How will you test the changes?

Kubebench tool will be used before and after the hardening to make sure all CIS checks pass. Tests including manual and
regression one are run.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?

1. Kube-bench tool will be run against the STAGING cluster, which is a similar setup to the production one.
2. The hardening will be done based on the official CIS recommendations.
3. Kube-bench tool will be run again to check if all check PASS
4. Tests are run including manual and regression ones to make sure the cluster is available, reachable and healthy
5. The prod cluster is backed up so a roll-back is possible
6. Steps 1-4 are run against the prod env
7. Rollback in case of any errors
